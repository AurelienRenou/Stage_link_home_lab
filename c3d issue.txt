Hello, 
There is a problem when we tried to open a c3d file that is in a another file which is not in the current one.
We use /.. to go back, and choose the file we wanted.
```python
root_path = "/".join(__file__.split("/")[:-1]) + "/.."

c3d_path = "/data/F0_boire_05.c3d"
```
If we simply run the script, the path use by python was 
```python
"/../data/F0_boire_05.c3d"
```
and it doesn't worked, the first "/" cause a problem.

If we debuged the script, the path was
```python
"C:/Users/renou/Documents/Stage_immersion/bioptim_exo/tracking/../data/F0_boire_05.c3d"
```
And then, it worked

We didn't find the reason, but we find a solution, if we write directly the "../" in the path file, it works
```python
c3d_path = "../data/F0_boire_05.c3d"
```
